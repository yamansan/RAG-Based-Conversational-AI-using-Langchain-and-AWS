# RAG-Based Conversational AI using LangChain and AWS Bedrock

## 📚 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**-based Conversational AI system using **LangChain** and **AWS Bedrock**. By integrating these technologies, the solution enhances chatbot interactions by providing accurate, context-aware, and real-time responses leveraging knowledge from structured and unstructured data sources.

The system employs **AWS Bedrock** for robust large language model (LLM) access and **LangChain** for seamless chaining of LLM calls, retrieval-based processing, and dynamic question-answering workflows.

---

## 🛠️ Features
- **RAG Architecture:** Combines LLMs with a retrieval system for more accurate and context-driven responses.
- **AWS Bedrock Integration:** Access to multiple foundation models (FM) from AWS.
- **LangChain Framework:** Simplified LLM orchestration, prompting, and retrieval steps.
- **Document Retrieval:** Efficient indexing and querying of custom document sources.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Conversational Framework:** LangChain
- **Cloud AI Service:** AWS Bedrock
- **Data Storage:** Amazon S3 (for document storage), DynamoDB (for embeddings)
