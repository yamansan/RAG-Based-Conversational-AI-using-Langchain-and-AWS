# RAG-Based Conversational AI using LangChain and AWS Bedrock

## 📚 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**-based Conversational AI system using **LangChain** and **AWS Bedrock**. By integrating these technologies, the solution enhances chatbot interactions by providing accurate, context-aware, and real-time responses leveraging knowledge from structured and unstructured data sources.

The system employs **AWS Bedrock** for robust large language model (LLM) access and **LangChain** for seamless chaining of LLM calls, retrieval-based processing, and dynamic question-answering workflows.

---

## 🛠️ Features
- **RAG Architecture:** Combines LLMs with a retrieval system for more accurate and context-driven responses.
- **AWS Bedrock Integration:** Access to multiple foundation models (FM) from AWS.
- **LangChain Framework:** Simplified LLM orchestration, prompting, and retrieval steps.
- **Document Retrieval:** Efficient indexing and querying of custom document sources.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Conversational Framework:** LangChain
- **Cloud AI Service:** AWS Bedrock
- **Data Storage:** Amazon S3 (for document storage), DynamoDB (for embeddings)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rag-conversational-ai.git
cd rag-conversational-ai
```

### 2. Environment Setup
```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate   # Mac/Linux
env\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

### 3. Add Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file to store environment configurations:
```env
AWS_REGION=your-region
BEDROCK_ENDPOINT=your-bedrock-endpoint
```

### 4. Data Preparation
Upload your documents to Amazon S3 or your desired storage solution. Ensure your documents are in a supported format for retrieval.

### 5. Model and Workflow Configuration
Define the LangChain workflow to include:
- **LLM Model Access:** AWS Bedrock integration.
- **Retrieval Pipeline:** Document chunking and vector storage.
- **Response Generation:** Context-aware conversational flow.

### 6. Running the Application
Start the FastAPI server (if implemented):
```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload
```
Access the application at [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)
